Names and desriptions

Ai niin, pitikö näistä vihollisten kuvauksista paljastua heikkoudet ja esimerkiksi, mitä taikoja ne käyttävät???

Pyramid

Enemy types

Scorpions
The black Scorpions are small, but menacing. Their grasping pedipalps open and close, and the venomous stingers at the end of their tails are curved forward, pointing straight at you...

Mummy Cat
Mummy Cat is licking its mummified, linen-wrapped paw, purring peacefully. Such a lovely cat! 

Mummy 
Mummy looks desolate, sad and disfigured. He seems to be searching for something, perhaps for his long-lost soul, or his embalmed heart. Then he feels his face, and a happy smile spreads across his face as he touches his glasses.

Sphinx
Sphinx has the body of a lioness and the head of a beautiful woman. She is carved out of a huge monolith. She does seem a little... stoned... (Tää on kyl aika tosi huono jo...:))

Anubis
Anubis, the Jackal-headed God of the Dead, the Protector of Tombs, the Embalmer, the Mother of Dragons, the Guide of Souls... His strength is his jackal-like fighting, and his weakness is that he's imaginary.
